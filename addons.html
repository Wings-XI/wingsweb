<h1>Addons and Plugins for WingsXI</h1>

<p>Many users will notice that Ashita requires auto updates enabled to use their Addons/Plugins tab.  However, turning on Ashita auto updates will break certain addons due to Wings using an older client version than Ashita supports.  Some of the addons in this archive may have been modified slightly for use on Wings.</p>

<p>Below you will find a link to a masterlist of addons that are pre-approved for use on WingsXI.  If you have any questions about any additional addons or plugins, please reach out to a GM using the GM ticketing system in Discord.  Not knowing whether an addon is legal or not <i>does not</i> exclude you from the consequences of using them if you are caught to be in violation of the rules.</p>
