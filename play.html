<h1>How to play</h1>
The recommended way to play on wings is to use our official installer, available on our Discord.<br>
<br>
It is also possible to connect using the standard Topaz bootloader by specifying <b>--server game.wingsxi.com</b><br>
Please note however using a different client version may cause some issues, including:
<ul>
<li>Wrong NPC names</li>
<li>Cutscenes hanging, which in some cases may require restarting the client</li>
<li>Certain values such as conquest point item purchase price, spell MP cost and others will be incorrect</li>
</ul>
Due to the above, bug reports will only be accepted when using the official client.<br>
<br>
To create an account, use the signup link on the left menu. Your website credentials are also used to log-in to the game. It is <i>not</i> possible to register an account through the bootloader.<br>
<br>
Enjoy your stay!<br>
