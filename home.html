<table width=100%><tr><td width="50%" valign="top"><h1>WingsXI has a new home!</h1>
The server has been merged with <a href="https://www.catseyexi.com/login.php">CatsEyeXI</a>. Please <a href="https://www.bg-wiki.com/ffxi/CatsEyeXI_Content/Wings_Era_Warrior">visit the FAQ</a> for information about how a world within a world was custom built for us there.
<br>
<br>
If you still have your WingsXI install, it is possible to import Macros and Equipsets into the CatsEyeXI install. It is an intermediate-level process on a technical level, but there are plenty of people to help out in the <a href="https://discord.gg/catseyexi">CatsEyeXI discord</a>. The basic process is this though:
<ul>
    <li>Install and run the CatsEyeXI launcher</li>
    <li>Create a WEW account, link your old WingsXI account, and import your characters</li>
    <li>Create a profile in the launcher for this new account</li>
    <li>Log in</li>
    <li>Once you have logged into the CEXI server, a folder will be made in your install path: \catseyexi\catseyexi-client\Game\FINAL FANTASY XI\USER</li>
    <li>The folder will be the hex conversion of your char id (i.e. 496c would be charid 18796), which you can get from the CatsEyeXI website URL when you view your character</li>
    <li>Simply paste everything from your similar folder in the WingsXI data: \WingsXI\SquareEnix\FINAL FANTASY XI\USER</li>
    <li>Again, the folders are named by the hex conversion of your character id, available by logging into the WingsXI website (or contacting a CEXI GM)</li>
    <li>Know that this folder contains all your settings for that particular character, so you can always log out, delete the folder, then log back in to build it from scratch</li>
</ul>
The process to move Ashitacast XML files is a bit simpler.
<ul>
    <li>Step one is to copy all your XML files from your WingsXI install: \WingsXI\Ashita\config\AshitaCast</li>
    <li>And place them in the LegacyAC config folder: \catseyexi\catseyexi-client\Ashita\config\LegacyAC</li>
    <li>Now you must load the LegacyAC plugin. This can be done by adding '/load legacyac' to your default.txt: \catseyexi\catseyexi-client\Ashita\scripts\default.txt</li>
</ul>
