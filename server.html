<strong>RMT Changes:</strong> RMT changes have been reverted and moved to their original locations for the following items. This means no versions of the following drop from corresponding battlefiends.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cross-Counters (Western Shadow)</li>
<li>Eurytos&#8217;s Bow (Eastern Shadow)</li>
<li>Leaping Boots (Leaping Lizzy)</li>
<li>Ochiudo&#8217;s Kote (Mee Deggi the Punisher)</li>

<li>Astral Ring (Coffer chests in Castle of Oztroja)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Loot:</strong> Chests and Coffers are instant repops to allow access to quest items for players.  Players who open coffers or chests for loot will incur a 30-minute zone-wide illusion timer that will not allow them to open another coffer or chest to gain loot until the illusion timer wears off.</p>
<p><strong>Beastmaster:</strong> All high quality versions of Beastmaster jug pets have had their level cap raised to level 75.  Normal quality versions retain their normal level caps.</p>
<p><strong>Crossbow Bolts / Wooden Arrow:</strong> All jobs are able to equip, primarily for THF's benefit since it has no low level Marksmanship ammo.</p>
<p><strong>Kindred Seals:</strong> Since HNMs are only accessible through KS99s, the droprate of Kindred Seals has been increased.</p>
