<h1>Rules</h1>
Wings strives to create a fun and friendly and fair environment to all players.<br>
Therefore, by joining Wings you agree to the following rules:
<h3>Any of the following activities may lead to permanent ban without warning</h3>
<ul>
<li>RMT (Real Money Trade) - Any activity involving real world money, including the sale or purchase of accounts, in-game currency and/or items. All in-game commerce is limited to in-game currency.</li>
<li>MPK (Monster Player Killing) - Intentionally attempting to cause the KO of another player, either by luring monsters to attack players or any other means.</li>
<li>Exploiting any bugs or oversights in order to gain an unfair advantage over other players, be it in adventuring or commerce. Finding and reporting such bugs without taking advantage of them is not considered a violation as long as it does not impact the server performance and/or stability. We therefore encourage the use of a local copy of the server for bug hunting.</li>
<li>Botting - Using any third party tools or scripts which automate player activity, other than tools explicitly allowed and the in-game macro feature. This includes things like infinite loop scripts to skill up magic skill, infinite crafting beyond what is possible with a /waitsynth macro, fishing bots or any type of scripted actions that require zero player input.</li>
<li>Tool assisted claiming of any kind will be met with an immediate ban. While we don't expect this to come up often due to the nature of how Notorious Monsters are set up on Wings, please be aware that we ARE able to detect these.</li>
<li>Using explicitly disallowed third party tools or addons.</li>
<li>Ignoring or disobeying instructions from GMs (Game Masters), who may monitor game activity either visibly or hidden. If a GM gives you a direct order, follow the order, even if it is not explicitly mentuioned in the rules. While you may not find it to be fair in the moment, instead of going off on that GM, simply do what they say and then reach out to a senior GM in the discord or forums for further assistance, where you will have a fair chance to speak out.</li>
<li>Repeated violation of any other rule after being warned.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Other rules</h3>
These following activities are forbidden and violations will be enforced and violations may lead to various penalties according to GM discretion.
<ul>
<li>Harrassment of any other player after being told to stop once.</li>
<li>Any form of racism, including, but not limited to, skin color, sex or sexual orientation, religion, ethnicity, country etc.</li>
<li>Asking for information regarding players' personal (i.e. real-world) life or identity if they do not wish to disclose it.</li>
<li>Using foul language or deragatory terms in yells.</li>
<li>Insulting or humiliating other players in public chats.</li>
<li>Dual-boxing or any form of having more than a single character logged-in at once. If there are multiple players in a single household (e.g. family members) please notify the server administrators to avoid wrongful enforcement.</li>
<li>Account sharing is not allowed. This is tracked and can easily be detected. Furthermore, if your friend cheats, you may suffer the consequences with them if they get caught. Better to be safe than sorry.</li>
<li>Not responding to GM messages while your character is not idle, as this may be an indication of botting.</li>
<li>Using third party tools or addons to gain an unfair advantage - If such a tool or addon is not on the explict allowed or disallowed list, please use common sense. If uncertain, ask a GM or administrator.</li>
<li>Market manipulation or any kind, including faux sells on the auction house for the purpose of wiping the sale history, price fixing or otherwise any means of blocking healthy competition. This is easily tracked. Beyond any type of suspension/ban that may incur, your fellow players will probably judge you pretty harshly since it isn't hard for them to figure out what's happening. Don't be that guy/girl.</li>
<li>Navmesh abuses are not allowed. A navmesh abuse is taking advantage of bugs in how mobs move to reach a position where you can hit the mob but the mob can't hit you or someone else from your party back (including healers). The rule does not apply when you're running for your life with no intention of fighting.</li>
<li>Obtaining and/or using OOE items that were left due to an oversight (OOE = Out of Era, items that were not available in the WotG era). If such items are found in circulation they will be confiscated and no refund will be given.</li> 
</ul>

<h3>Jail</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you're sent to Modrion Gaol a GM is likely to show up and talk to you. Answer all questions honestly.</li>
<li>Do not immediately disconnect if you're jailed. If you disconnect immediately this will result in a ban.</li>
<li>Do not lie to GMs as it is very likely that they have proof of your violation. Attempting to deny such violations will only make matters worse and can lead to a punishment way harsher than what was originally intended.</li>
<li>If you have been jailed but no GM shows up it is likely you were jailed by the automated cheat detection system. In case of a mistaken auto-jail or if your offense is not one of the banned-without-warning violations described above, open a GM ticket using the helpdesk menu. Mind that the auto-jailer keeps extensive logs and we <i>will</i> be able to know what happened.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Yells</h3>
The /yell command is a server-wide command. To prevent abuse, its use is limited to once every 15 minutes.<br>
In order to avoid too many irrelevant yells, please abide by the following rules (violations may result in being muted form using yells):<br>
<br>
Allowed:
<ul>
<li>Commerce (Want to buy/sell/trade) items, teleports, mercenery services etc.</li>
<li>Parties (looking for party/looking for members)</li>
<li>Linkshells (looking for LS/looking for members)</li>
<li>Asking for help / offering help</li>
<li>Asking game related questions</li>
</ul>
Not allowed:
<ul>
<li>Spamming</li>
<li>Any offensive language, including random insults</li>
<li>Offering services that violate the rules</li>
<li>Replying to quetions that have already been answered</li>
<li>Asking for GM help more than once</li>
<li>Any non-FFXI related talk</li>
</ul>

<h3>Addons / Plugins</h3>
While most servers have a specific list of allowed/disallowed Ashita / Windower addons to use, we find it easier to instead list out the types of addons that are not allowed, and then point out any specific ones as a reference.
<ul>
<li>Auction house addons of any kind are not allowed. This includes any addon that either allows you to open the auction house from anywhere except an auction counter, or any addon that interacts with the auction house in any way. Exception: InstaAH or any Windower equivalent are allowed as long as they do not do anything other than remove the delay.</li>
<li>Targeting addons. This includes addons similar to SetTarget. The use of Shorthand for target claiming is also not allowed, and is easily trackable.</li>
<li>Addons which display Mob IDs are not allowed.</li>
<li>Any position or speed hack. The server is set up to detect these automatically and the use of them will likely trigger the autojail feature.</li>
<li>Any automation that involves crafting, fishing or gathering. This should be a self explanatory rule.</li>
<li>Healbot. While this likely won't be as much of an issue due to there being no dual boxing, anyone found to be using an addon that automates actions will be banned.</li>
</ul>
If you think an addon you would like to use may potentially be against these general rules, please reach out and ask.<br>
<b>Note:</b> Ashitacast and Gearswap ARE allowed. These addons serve a similar function to what in-game macros can accomplish and thus have been approved for use. Happy swapping.<br>

<h3>GMs / Staff</h3>
<ul>
<li>GM tickets can be opened via the in-game helpdesk menu or through the support page on the website. Mind that there may not always be a GM online. We have normal lives and normal jobs, and are all volunteers, so please be patient and eventually someone will get back to you. Please do not harass staff members via Discord or in-game. Use the appropriate channels to reach out to GMs.</li>
<li>The development team and the GM team are two separate entities. While some lead developers technically have GM access, they will only use it in case of a serverwide issue. Only members of the GM team are in charge of tickets.</li>
<li>Staff's player characters are not GMs - We created this server because we want to have fun playing on it, not because we want to police it. In order to prevent abuse GMs are not allowed to play on the same character, which means that even if you see someone from the staff playing, their current character is not a GM and they cannot help unless they stop playing and switch to their GM character, which is up to their discretion.</li>
<li>The GM policy is no intervention unless absolutely necessary. By "absolutely necessary" we mean either a serious issue which occurs as a result of a bug or a glitch or a serious and clear violation of the rules.</li>
<li>GMs will not intervene if something is just "not fair or not nice". If someone kicked you out of a party for whatever reason it may not be nice but it's not a violation. Nobody forces you to party with that person ever again. If someone sells an Onion Dagger for 100k, it's worth 100k if someone's willing to pay that much for it.</li>
<li>GMs do not have to intervene in cases where glitches occur as a result of using a wrong client version, e.g. cutscenes that hang in the mission 2-3 dragon fight or anything similar, because there are enough warnings about using a wrong version. Download the Wings installation and try again.</li>
<li>GMs do not have to intervene in anything that has a self-service option. If you're stuck under the map, you can use !unstuck, if you forgot your password, you can reset it through the website. GMs may help if they feel like the situation is exceptional but it's completely up to them.</li>
</ul>
