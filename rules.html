<h1>Rules</h1>
Wings strives to create a fun and friendly and fair environment to all players.<br>
Therefore, by joining Wings you agree to the following rules and terms:
<h3>Any of the following activities may lead to permanent ban without warning</h3>
<ul>
<li>RMT (Real Money Trade) - Any activity involving real world money, including the sale or purchase of accounts, in-game currency and/or items.  This rule also extends to the trading of in-game services for out-of-game forms of currency, including things like Twitch subscriptions, channel points, etc as these are tied directly to actual forms of currency. All in-game commerce is limited to in-game currency. <b>Any RMT activity will lead to an immediate and permanent ban of both the seller and the buyer</b>.</li>
<li>Multiboxing.  Wings has a custom built anti-multiboxing login server, and using any sort of means to bypass the single-character login restriction is strictly against the rules.  If you have multiple players who live in the same household full-time, please create an IP exception ticket via our <a href="https://discord.com/channels/787521272522473483/853672060004860016/853680574522064906">Discord GM ticketing system</a> and a staff member will guide you through the process.
<li>The use of unauthorized addons or plugins.  Please scroll below to learn more information about the types of addons and plugins that are allowed.  <b>If you think an addon you would like to use may potentially be against the general rules, please reach out to a staff member in Discord by <a href="https://discord.com/channels/787521272522473483/853672060004860016/853680574522064906">making a GM ticket</a> and ask befor using it. Claiming that "it wasn't specifically listed on the rules page" will not pardon you of consequences should you be found using any type of addon that is not allowed.</b></li>
<li>MPK (Monster Player Killing) - Intentionally attempting to cause the KO of another player, either by luring monsters to attack players or any other means.</li>
<li>Exploiting any bugs or oversights in order to gain an unfair advantage over other players, be it in adventuring or commerce. Finding and reporting such bugs without taking advantage of them is not considered a violation as long as it does not impact the server performance and/or stability. We therefore encourage making use of the beta test server or a local copy of the server for bug hunting.  Bug hunting on the live server is not allowed, and will not pardon you of any consequences should your actions be considered cheating or affect the server in a negative way.</li>
<li>Botting - Using any third party tools or scripts which automate player activity, other than tools explicitly allowed and the in-game macro feature. This includes things like infinite loop scripts to skill up magic skill, infinite crafting beyond what is possible with a /waitsynth macro, fishing bots or any type of scripted actions that require zero player input.</li>
<li>Tool assisted claiming of any kind will be met with an immediate ban. While we don't expect this to come up often due to the nature of how Notorious Monsters are set up on Wings, please be aware that we ARE able to detect these.</li>
<li>Using explicitly disallowed third party tools or addons.</li>
<li>Ignoring or disobeying instructions from GMs (Game Masters), who may monitor game activity either visibly or hidden. If a GM gives you a direct order, follow the order, even if it is not explicitly mentioned in the rules. While you may not find it to be fair in the moment, instead of going off on that GM, simply do what they say and then reach out to a senior GM in the discord or forums for further assistance, where you will have a fair chance to speak out.</li>
<li>Repeated violation of any other rule after being warned.</li>

</ul>
<h3>Other rules</h3>
These following activities are forbidden and violations will be enforced and violations may lead to various penalties according to GM discretion.
<ul>
<li>Harrassment of any other player after being told to stop once by any staff member.  (Orange names in Discord, or in-game GMs.)</li>
<li>Any form of racism, including, but not limited to, skin color, sex or sexual orientation, religion, ethnicity, country etc.</li>
<li>Asking for information regarding players' personal (i.e. real-world) life or identity if they do not wish to disclose it.</li>
<li>Using foul language or deragatory terms in yells.</li>
<li>Insulting or humiliating other players in public chats.</li>
<li>Account sharing is not allowed. This is tracked and can easily be detected. Furthermore, if your friend cheats, you may suffer the consequences with them if they get caught. Better to be safe than sorry.</li>
<li>Not responding to GM messages while your character is not idle, as this may be an indication of botting.</li>
<li>Using third party tools or addons to gain an unfair advantage - If such a tool or addon is not on the explict allowed or disallowed list, please use common sense. If uncertain, ask a GM or administrator.</li>
<li>Market manipulation or any kind, including faux sells on the auction house for the purpose of wiping the sale history, price fixing or otherwise any means of blocking healthy competition. This is easily tracked. Beyond any type of suspension/ban that may incur, your fellow players will probably judge you pretty harshly since it isn't hard for them to figure out what's happening. Don't be that guy/girl.</li>
<li>Navmesh abuses are not allowed. A navmesh abuse is taking advantage of bugs in how mobs move to reach a position where you can hit the mob but the mob can't hit you or someone else from your party back (including healers). The rule does not apply when you're running for your life with no intention of fighting.</li>
<li>Obtaining and/or using OOE items that were left due to an oversight (OOE = Out of Era, items that were not available in the WotG era). If such items are found in circulation they will be confiscated and no refund will be given.</li>
<li>Intentionally dying shortly before conquest tally in order to hinder another nation's effort is not allowed. GMs are monitoring conquest regions and will know if that happens.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Mordion Gaol (AKA Jail)</h3>
<ul>
<li>You may end up in Mordion Gaol either manually by a GM or by an automated jailing system designed to detect and take action against known cheating methods.</li>
<li>If you were jailed by a GM, they are likely to show up and talk to you. Answer all questions honestly, as they have access to logs and can verify your claims.</li>
<li>If you were jailed by the automated cheat detection system, you will see an NPC named "Read Me", please speak with it in order to find out what to do next.</li>
<li>In either case, please be aware that our logging keeps very detailed track of player actions. These will need to be manually reviewed by the GM team and may take some time to review as a group before coming to a decision.</li>
<li>Do not immediately disconnect if you're jailed. If you disconnect immediately, the staff will not be able to easily get a hold of you. Furthermore, disconnecting immediately after being sent to jail is a pretty obvious sign that you have something to hide. If you need to log out before a GM speaks with you, <a href="https://discord.com/channels/787521272522473483/853672060004860016/853680574522064906">put in a GM ticket</a> on Discord to let someone know you're in Mordion before you log off including your full character name and what you were doing at the time you were dragged to Mordion.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Yells</h3>
The /yell command is a server-wide command. To prevent abuse, its use is limited to once every 15 minutes.<br>
In order to avoid too many irrelevant yells, please abide by the following rules (violations may result in being muted form using yells):<br>
<br>
Allowed:
<ul>
<li>Commerce (Want to buy/sell/trade) items, teleports, mercenery services etc.</li>
<li>Parties (looking for party/looking for members)</li>
<li>Linkshells (looking for LS/looking for members)</li>
<li>Asking for help / offering help</li>
<li>Asking game related questions</li>
</ul>
Not allowed:
<ul>
<li>Spamming</li>
<li>Any offensive language, including random insults</li>
<li>Offering services that violate the rules</li>
<li>Replying to quetions that have already been answered</li>
<li>Asking for GM help more than once</li>
<li>Any non-FFXI related talk</li>
</ul>

<h3>Addons / Plugins</h3>
While most servers have a specific list of allowed/disallowed Ashita / Windower addons to use, we find it easier to instead list out the types of addons that are not allowed, and then point out any specific ones as a reference. <b> If you think an addon you would like to use may potentially be against the general rules, please reach out to a staff member in Discord by <a href="https://discord.com/channels/787521272522473483/853672060004860016/853680574522064906">making a GM ticket</a> and ask befor using it.  Claiming that "it wasn't specifically listed on the rules page" is not an acceptable excuse to use these addons.</b>
<ul>
<li>Auction house addons of any kind are not allowed. This includes any addon that either allows you to open the auction house from anywhere except an auction counter, or any addon that interacts with the auction house in any way. This includes auction scanners, listers, etc. Exception: InstaAH or any Windower equivalent are allowed as long as they do not do anything other than remove the delay.</li>
<li>Targeting addons. This includes addons similar to SetTarget. The use of Shorthand for target claiming is also not allowed, and is easily trackable.</li>
<li>Any position or speed hack. The server is set up to detect these automatically and the use of them will likely trigger the autojail feature.</li>
<li>Any automation that involves crafting, fishing or gathering. This should be a self explanatory rule.</li>
<li>Healbot. While this likely won't be as much of an issue due to there being no dual boxing, anyone found to be using an addon that automates actions will be banned.</li>
</ul>
<b>Note:</b> Ashitacast and Gearswap ARE allowed but only for the purpose of changing gear. These addons serve a similar function to what in-game macros can accomplish and thus have been approved for use. Happy swapping.<br>

<h3>GMs / Staff</h3>
<ul>
<li>Remember that when interacting with staff members, you are expected to handle yourself respectfully and appropriately.  All of our staff members are offering their help to the server often at the expense of their own play time, and they're all adults with families, jobs, and other responsibilities.  There may sometimes be a delay in their ability to help you with an issue due to this.  Being rude to staff who are trying to help you is a surefire way to not be helped again in the future.  Please treat our volunteers with the respect that they deserve for helping deliver something that you enjoy so much.</li>
<li>If you are having an issue, <b>DO NOT</b> reach out to a staff member via Discord DMs or in-game on their player characters (which have no GM permissions and therefore cannot help you).  The correct course of action is to use the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/787521272522473483/853672060004860016/853680574522064906">Discord GM ticketing system.</a></li>
<li>Keep in mind that the only people who can help you with server-related issues are <u>Game Masters and Staff Members.</u>  These people are brown and orange names in Discord.  Any other people in Discord with colored names are likely community support specialists who provide value to the server in various ways that do not include Game Master responsibilities.  Please do not reach out to those people asking for Game Master related isues.</li>
<li>Do not contact developers regarding GM issues, since not all developers are Game Masters (in fact most of them are not) and not all Game Masters are developers. Any issues that affect you specifically should be reported using the Discord ticketing system. Any issues that affect the entire server should be reported on the project bugtracker.</li>
<li>The Game Masters are trusted to exercise their best discretion when helping players.  This means that the GM that is helping you with your ticket may not handle it exactly the same way that a previous GM may have.  If you have an issue with how a situation was handled, feel free to open a new ticket and a different member of staff can verify that things were handled appropriately.</li>
<li>Game Masters will <b>not</b> intervene in situations that can be remedied via the use of the blacklist function, however Game Masters may step in if harassment escalates beyond a point at which a player cannot simply "block and move on."  This includes targetted harassment of a player via in-game griefing, MPK, abuse of the mail system, etc.  This <i>does not</i> extend to things like economic competition, NM camping, etc.</li>
<li>Game Masters will <b>not</b> intervene if a player's actions do not violate the rules, even if they are "not nice". Please read the rules and verify that the player is indeed in violation before reporting them.</li>
<li>Game Masters will <b>not</b> intervene in cases where a glitch occurs as a result of user error or incorrect addons/versions causing issues, e.g. cutscenes hanging, in-game messages being incorrect, etc.  GMs will advise you to download the Wings installation and try again.</li>
<li>Game Masters will usually not intervene in cases where a self-service function is available, such as not being able to move (use !unstuck) or password resets. If you believe your case is an exception please describe in your GM ticket why the self-service option did not help.</li>
</ul>
